# code-exercise

The following is a basic exercise to help us to understand your coding style and assess your approach to solving a standard problem. This exercise is intended to be completed in with minimal time investment, so no stress necessary. 

Using the included MockData.json file as your data source, please complete the following exercise. 

**Task #1: Backend**
Build a search API using Node that allows a user to enter the name of a property and return that property or search for a location and return multiple results.
Relevant data fields for the property can be identified using the design provided

**Task #2: Frontend**
Using the provided design, use your API to retrieve results and display results as shown in the design building using React.
On search, the text should provide autocomplete options based on the properties located in the system.

*Note: The data in MockData.json is generated, so you will want to modify to reflect some valid locations on the map*

**Task #3: Make it better**
Extend the solution by adding at least one significant feature that you feel would bring value to the solution.

**Task #4: Delivery**
Submit your solution via e-mail as a github repository link, a zip file, or a codesandbox.io sandbox. 

*Note: Your solution should build and run*
